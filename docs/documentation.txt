IMPORT NOTE:

EMBEDDED SCRIPTING:

You may attach scripts that can execute external processes. Or you may use a script to alter the world or the player in some way. This latter provides
you with the ability to define specific end game constraints that best fit your story.

If you plan to use a script to dynamically alter the world during play, you must use the getters for each object
provided. If you do not do this, your changes will not carry through if the game is saved and loaded.
An example of this is shown in the "caveWaterfallScript" function in the example author file.
